    <h1>An Undirected Tree</h1>
    <h4>Like a tree in a forest, this resourcee will be useful for all. Though to understand trees, it is necessary to start with the roots, then move to leaves and branches.</h4>
    </header>
    <p1>
    The point of this site is to provide as many roots for as many people as possible. This is completely open to whoever wants to visit and learn mathematics and its applications. The site will be left as simple as possible to eliminate distraction and pretentiousness so it can be accessible by anyone.
    </p1>
    
    <p>To start, here are some possibilities:</p>
    <ul>
        <h4>Mathematics</h4>
        <li>Geometry</li>
        <li>Algebra</li>
        <li>Basics of Math Logic and Proofs</li>
        
        <br></br>

        <h4>Programming</h4>
        <li>Basics with Python</li>
        <li>Relational Databases with SQL</li>
        <li>Non-Relational Databases with MongoDB</li>
        <li>Graph Databases with Neo4j</li>
    </ul>
